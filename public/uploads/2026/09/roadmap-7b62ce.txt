# What is planned, and what each one has to decide first

**Written against 0.38.0**, after a look at the blog that is moving here, so that the work would
start with decisions rather than with guessing. Two of the four are built since.

| | | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Where a post lives — the URL | **built in 0.47.0**, as the `post_path` setting |
| 2 | A recent posts block | planned |
| 3 | Featured posts, by tag | **built in 0.39.0**, as the listing rather than as a block |
| 4 | A weight, for ordering posts by hand | **built in 0.57.0** |

---

## 1. Where a post lives

> **Built in 0.47.0.** `post_path` is a setting: `/post/<slug>` (the default, and what every

The blog's posts are at the root with a trailing slash:
`https://gopherlab.net/internet-dosbox-x-windows-3-11/`. Here is what dpress does with that shape
today:

| URL | today |
|---|---|
| `/internet-dosbox-x-windows-3-11/` | **404** — posts do not live at the root |
| `/post/internet-dosbox-x-windows-3-11` | the post |
| `/post/internet-dosbox-x-windows-3-11/` | **404** — the post route rejects a trailing slash |
| `/about/` | the page — the catch-all already tolerates a trailing slash |

So as it stands, moving the blog changes every post URL. **That is the expensive part of a move**,
and it is expensive in a way comments are not: backlinks, search rankings, and every link anybody
ever wrote to a post. Decide it before importing, because changing it afterwards means changing it
twice.

### It is a small change, and the reason is already in the schema

`Content::$slug` is **globally unique across posts and pages** — one flat namespace, by design. So
a root-level URL has exactly one answer and there is nothing to disambiguate. `findByPath()`
already looks a slug up and then rejects anything that is not a page:

```php
$content = $this->findBySlug(end($segments), $publishedOnly);
if ($content === null || !$content->isPage()) {
    return [null, true];      // <- this is the whole restriction
}
```

The work is therefore: a setting for the post URL shape, `findByPath()` accepting a post when the
setting says so, `ContentService::path()` answering with the same shape, and the existing
**canonical 301** doing the rest — the machinery that already sends `/wrong/path/to/about` to
`/about` sends `/post/x` to `/x` for free.

### What to decide

- **Which shape**: `/post/<slug>` (today) or `/<slug>` (WordPress's, and the blog's). Only the
  second preserves the existing URLs.
- **Trailing slash**: **decided, 0.64.0** - one canonical URL without the slash, and a 301 to it.
  It lives in the app skeleton's `.htaccess` rather than in the router, so the redirect happens
  before PHP starts and costs no boot. What settled it was that the two shapes were already
  disagreeing: `/category/x/` was a 404, because `?` matches exactly one segment and the empty
  one after the slash makes three, while `/a-post/` answered **200** off the `/*` catch-all -
  the same page at two addresses with nothing naming the real one, which is the worse of the
  two because a 404 at least tells somebody. An nginx deployment gets nothing from this and
  would want the same rule in its own config, or a redirect in the middleware chain.
- **Old URLs that are not just this**: date-based permalinks, `?p=123`, an old feed address. If
  the blog only ever used post-name permalinks, the shape above covers everything and no redirect
  table is needed. Worth checking before assuming.

**The comments turned out not to be part of this.** The blog's Disqus threads are keyed
`573 https://gopherlab.net/?p=573` — the WordPress post id, not the permalink — so they follow the
id across and are indifferent to what the URL becomes. See [comments.md](comments.md) §6, step 2.
That leaves this decision resting on backlinks and search rankings alone, which is still reason
enough, but it is one argument rather than two.

## 2. A recent posts block

The easy one, and it needs nothing that does not exist: another type registered in `Blocks`,
alongside the tag cloud and the category list.

- **Settings**: how many (default 5), and whether to show the date.
- **The query is `content_list`**, already registered, already narrowable by a plugin — posts,
  published, newest first, limited.
- **"Not the one you are reading"** is the only interesting part: a recent-posts block in the
  sidebar of a post should not list that post. That needs to know which page it is on, which is
  the same `PageContext` [comments.md](comments.md) §3b asks for. Build it once, and both want it.

Half a day, most of which is the template.

---

## 3. Featured posts

Five posts at the top of the front page, chosen by giving them a `featured` tag.

**The tag as the switch is a good choice**, because it needs no new column, no new screen and no
new concept: an author already knows how to tag a post, and un-featuring is removing a tag. Two
details to settle:

- **A convention or a setting?** `featured` hardcoded is simpler; a setting naming the tag means a
  Hungarian site can call it `kiemelt`. A setting, defaulting to `featured`, costs almost nothing.
- **Do featured posts also appear in the list below?** Pinned *and* repeated four rows down reads
  as a bug. Excluding them is one more condition on the listing query.

### The part worth knowing before starting

**This is the feature that makes block visibility rules necessary**, and that is worth saying
plainly because it was deliberately left out of 0.37.0.

A featured strip belongs at the top of the *front page* and nowhere else. As things stand a block
renders in a place on every page that renders that place, so a "featured posts" block would sit on
top of every post as well. Two ways out:

- **Do it in the listing**, not as a block: a `featured_posts` query, `HomeController` passing them
  to the template, and the theme deciding what a featured post looks like. No new core concept, and
  it is genuinely home-page furniture rather than a block somebody moves around.
- **Or add visibility rules** to blocks — "front page only", "posts only" — and make it a block.
  That is a second grammar to design, and it is the thing that was put off; if it is going to be
  built, this is the feature that should pay for it.

**Recommended: the listing.** A featured strip is not something anybody will want in a sidebar,
and the block version costs a new grammar to express one condition.

## 4. A weight, for ordering by hand

> **Built in 0.57.0**, as the tiebreaker recommended below. An `int weight` on `Content`,
> `weight desc` in front of the date in `contentList`, `contentByTag`, `contentByCategory`
> and `contentChildren` — through one `orderContent()` helper, so the four cannot drift apart

> It is **validated rather than cast**, because `(int)` never fails — `1o` would have been 1

Posts have no drag handle, because they are not a tree — so ordering them by hand needs a number
in the editor rather than a position among siblings. That is the right read: `position` belongs to
things that have siblings, and a post's siblings are "every other post".

What has to be decided is what the number *means*, and there are only two honest answers:

- **A tiebreaker on top of the date**: `order by weight desc, published_at desc`. A weight of `0`
  is normal, anything higher floats up. **A no-op until somebody sets one**, which is what makes it
  safe to add to every listing at once.
- **A sort order in its own right**, replacing the date. Simpler to reason about and much worse to
  live with: every new post arrives at weight 0 and lands at the bottom.

**Recommended: the tiebreaker**, `weight desc, published_at desc`, applied in `contentList` so that
the front page, categories and tags all agree about what order posts are in.

The rest is mechanical: an `int weight` column on `Content` defaulting to 0, a number field in the
editor, and the column in the admin list so it can be seen and sorted. Adding a column before 1.0
means `database/reset.sh` — which is safe again now that the fox is a seed file.

**It overlaps §3 more than it looks.** "Featured, and in this order" is a weight on a featured
post; "pin this one post to the top" is a weight with no tag at all. If both get built, build the
weight first and let the featured strip order by it.

## 5. What core has to grow

Everything above, as one list — three of the five are wanted by more than one feature, which is the
argument for doing them first.

| Core change | Wanted by |
|---|---|
| Post URL shape as a setting, `findByPath()` serving posts | §1 |
| `PageContext` — which content is being viewed | §2, and comments |
| `featured_posts` query, or block visibility rules | §3 |
| `weight` column, and `contentList` ordering by it | §4, §3 |
| A place before the content, if the featured strip becomes a block | §3 only |

## 6. To answer tomorrow

- ~~**Post URLs**~~ — answered: both, as a setting, and `/post/<slug>` redirects to whichever is
  in force. gopherlab is on `/<slug>`.
- Does the blog use anything but post-name permalinks? **Still worth checking** - date-based
  permalinks or `?p=123` would need a redirect table, which none of this provides.
- **Featured**: the listing, or a block with visibility rules?
- Is the tag name `featured`, or a setting?
- **Weight**: a tiebreaker above the date, or the whole order?
